Bluehost is a much more robust provider, which means that it creates a strong and comprehensive service. But what does it mean for you? The answer is ... Perks! User benefits such as free domain, WordPress integration and better value for money are all part of Bluehost's trusted reputation.

SiteGround has grown rapidly since its inception in 2004 and has become a leading hosting provider. This reflects their focus on speed, service and customer support. As you can see from the table, against Bluehost has and also has something to offer.

Both are strong choices. That you need to think about what is important to your site. Is a free domain better than a free deposit? Do you use or plan to use WordPress? What is your budget and how much do you want to get for your money?

Depending on the answers to these questions, you may find that you trust one provider more than the other. Siteground vs. Bluehost - Advantages and Benefits: Judgment

Both providers pride themselves on ease of use and a broad customer base. They are newly friendly and also scalable for more experienced users. This means that no matter what level you are at or what your site is, you have to be at home somehow.

These are other features that can be used that can really influence your decision.

domain
One of the ways Bluehost really stands out from its competitors is by offering free domain names, which is an attractive attraction for many users. This is a great advantage worth taking full advantage of!

It is worth noting that the domain is not covered by the money back guarantee - Bluehost will charge a registration fee of $ 15.99 from your return. It simply means that the domain name is entirely yours, regardless of the status of your hosting service. This means that you are the owner of your domain, even if you cancel your Bluehost plan. You can do whatever you want until the change comes, at which point you can cancel or pay in full.

Other options
SiteGround does not offer a free domain, but provides free automatic daily backups of all its pricing plans. So what does that mean? Your data is backed up every day for 30 days, so you can easily restore your website, emails or files in the event of a crisis. If you have a StartUp plan, you will have to pay more for the repair, but it will be free if you upgrade to their GrowBig pricing plans and higher.

part of the terrain
SiteGround has a number of impressive features and is dedicated to excellent service. They place great emphasis on speed, safety and performance.
Both use cPanel for their interfaces, which is a well-known and trusted control panel used by host providers. Another feature they share is that they do not provide metric data transfer. Unmetered just means you’re not billed on how much you use (like having a phone contract rather than pay as you go). This is most helpful to those of you with either personal, small business or community sites. 

Unmetered data transfer allows your site to grow freely, rather than being capped or “metered” once a data limit is reached. There are still limits in place (like in that phone contract), but for small sites it’s really rare to get close to hitting that level. 

Uptime is excellent for both. This is very important because your visitors will not be able to access your site during downtime. Some downtime is inevitable, but with these two providers you can be sure that your site will work well 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

One important thing to note: SiteGround explains its working hours as 99.99%. We never said it wasn't! So at the time we tested their time on each other, we recorded 99.98%, which is the same level as Bluehost and even more impressive!

Siteground vs Bluehost - Features, performance and ease of use: The Judgment
Believe it or not, it's a draw. Bluehost is probably better for most of you, but it depends on your needs. If you want a free domain and unlimited disk space, Bluehost is for you. If free backup is more important to you, then SiteGround is the best choice.

Who has better WordPress integration?
Go high
WordPress is an important online presence - in fact, it has 31% power over the Internet! No wonder many of you want to create your site or already have WordPress set up.

WordPress itself has compiled a list of hosting providers that they consider "the best and smartest in the hosting world". At the top of the list is Bluehost, so they won. Bluehost and WordPress are a powerful couple in the world of hosting. Interestingly, SiteGround is the third provider on the list, making it a strong competitor. Since only three providers are mentioned, Bluehost normally blows this part of the water, but SiteGround is absolutely with them.

Choosing a provider for your WordPress site that doesn't have good integration with WordPress doesn't really make sense. It's like taking bikes on a bike and attaching them to a car. It doesn't fit, it doesn't allow you to drive fast, and more importantly, it won't work!

Both SiteGround and Bluehost have a strong focus on WordPress, offering one-click installation, 24/7 technical support, automatic updates, and free, fast, site migration and migration. They have collected so many and kept your tires for you - and make sure they are of the highest quality to have the best possible experience!

With additional benefits for everyone (such as SiteGround's own security and free Bluehost add-ons), WordPress users are sure to have a smile on their face.

Siteground vs. Bluehost - WordPress integration: judgment
WordPress recommends both, which is impressive! But with WordPress describing Bluehost as offering the "perfect WordPress platform," the winner is clear. Bluehost is at the top of the list.

Website migration support

Do you already have a website? Let's see which hosts make it easy to move your site to their servers.

Migration to SiteGround
SiteGround recommends that you migrate your site to their servers using the Migrator plugin - there are instructions on how to do this, and it seems simple.

If you want the migration to be done by an expert, the possibility exists - but how much it will cost is not clear (it seems that it could be based on the offer). Switch to Bluehost
Bluehost provides a free migration service for WordPress sites that meet their ethical requirements (which includes things like using the latest version of WordPress and without malware).

Free migration is a big plus, but unfortunately you'll only know if you're eligible to sign up for an account (although keep in mind that you'll always get a 30-day money back guarantee):
